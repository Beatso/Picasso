# Picasso

This is a discord bot to easily scale pixel art, so it can be at a visible resolution from the original image.

To scale an image, either mention the bot in a message with an image attached, or mention the bot in a reply to a message with an image attached.

Suggestions and bug reports should be reported as [issues](https://github.com/Beatso/Picasso/issues/new).
